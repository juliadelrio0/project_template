	abstract = {Viewing metabolism through the lens of exercise biology has proven an accessible and practical strategy to gain new insights into local and systemic metabolic regulation. Recent methodological developments have advanced understanding of the central role of skeletal muscle in many exercise-associated health benefits and have uncovered the molecular underpinnings driving adaptive responses to training regimens. In this Review, we provide a contemporary view of the metabolic flexibility and functional plasticity of skeletal muscle in response to exercise. First, we provide background on the macrostructure and ultrastructure of skeletal muscle fibres, highlighting the current understanding of sarcomeric networks and mitochondrial subpopulations. Next, we discuss acute exercise skeletal muscle metabolism and the signalling, transcriptional and epigenetic regulation of adaptations to exercise training. We address knowledge gaps throughout and propose future directions for the field. This Review contextualizes recent research of skeletal muscle exercise metabolism, framing further advances and translation into practice.},

	abstract = {Changes in mitochondrial capacity and quality play a critical role in skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction. In vivo measurements of mitochondrial capacity provide a clear link between physical activity and mitochondrial function in aging and heart failure, although the cause and effect relationship remains unclear. Age-related decline in mitochondrial quality leads to mitochondrial defects that affect redox, calcium, and energy-sensitive signaling by altering the cellular environment that can result in skeletal muscle dysfunction independent of reduced mitochondrial capacity. This reduced mitochondrial quality with age is also likely to sensitize skeletal muscle mitochondria to elevated angiotensin or beta-adrenergic signaling associated with heart failure. This synergy between aging and heart failure could further disrupt cell energy and redox homeostasis and contribute to exercise intolerance in this patient population. Therefore, the interaction between aging and heart failure, particularly with respect to mitochondrial dysfunction, should be a consideration when developing strategies to improve quality of life in heart failure patients. Given the central role of the mitochondria in skeletal and cardiac muscle dysfunction, mitochondrial quality may provide a common link for targeted interventions in these populations.},

	abstract = {Mitochondrial health is an important mediator of cellular function across a range of tissues, and as a result contributes to whole-body vitality in health and disease. Our understanding of the regulation and function of these organelles is of great interest to scientists and clinicians across many disciplines within our healthcare system. Skeletal muscle is a useful model tissue for the study of mitochondrial adaptations because of its mass and contribution to whole body metabolism. The remarkable plasticity of mitochondria allows them to adjust their volume, structure and capacity under conditions such as exercise, which is useful or improving metabolic health in individuals with various diseases and/or advancing age. Mitochondria exist within muscle as a functional reticulum which is maintained by dynamic processes of biogenesis and fusion, and is balanced by opposing processes of fission and mitophagy. The sophisticated coordination of these events is incompletely understood, but is imperative for organelle function and essential for the maintenance of an interconnected organelle network that is finely tuned to the metabolic needs of the cell. Further elucidation of the mechanisms of mitochondrial turnover in muscle could offer potential therapeutic targets for the advancement of health and longevity among our ageing populations. As well, investigating exercise modalities that are both convenient and capable of inducing robust mitochondrial adaptations are useful in fostering more widespread global adherence. To this point, exercise remains the most potent behavioural therapeutic approach for the improvement of mitochondrial health, not only in muscle, but potentially also in other tissues.

	abstract = {Mitochondria are not only central organelles in metabolism and energy conversion but are also platforms for cellular signaling cascades. Classically, the shape and ultrastructure of mitochondria were depicted as static. The discovery of morphological transitions during cell death and of conserved genes controlling mitochondrial fusion and fission contributed to establishing the concept that mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure are dynamically regulated by mitochondria-shaping proteins. These finely tuned, dynamic changes in mitochondrial shape can in turn control mitochondrial function, and their alterations in human diseases suggest that this space can be explored for drug discovery. Here, we review the basic tenets and molecular mechanisms of mitochondrial morphology and ultrastructure, describing how they can coordinately define mitochondrial function.},

	abstract = {The dynamic properties of mitochondria mdash including their fusion, fission, and degradation mdash are critical for their optimal function in energy generation. The interplay of fusion and fission confers widespread benefits on mitochondria, including efficient transport, increased homogenization of the mitochondrial population, and efficient oxidative phosphorylation. These benefits arise through control of morphology, content exchange, equitable inheritance of mitochondria, maintenance of high-quality mitochondrial DNA, and segregation of damaged mitochondria for degradation. The key components of the machinery mediating mitochondrial fusion and fission belong to the dynamin family of GTPases that utilize GTP hydrolysis to drive mechanical work on biological membranes. Defects in this machinery cause a range of diseases that especially affect the nervous system. In addition, several common diseases, including neurodegenerative diseases and cancer, strongly affect mitochondrial dynamics.},

As an essential step in the process of eukaryotic evolution, the size of the mitochondrial chromosome was drastically reduced, and the behaviour of mitochondria within eukaryotic cells radically changed. Recent advances have revealed how the organelle's behaviour has evolved to allow the accurate transmission of its genome and to become responsive to the needs of the cell and its own dysfunction. © 2014 Macmillan Publishers Limited.
